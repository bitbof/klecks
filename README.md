Klecks (German for "splash of color", pronounced "clex") is the official open-source release of the community-funded online painting app [Kleki](https://kleki.com).

Klecks can run in standalone mode (e.g. on [kleki.com](https://kleki.com)), or embed (e.g. on [2draw.net](https://2draw.net)) for drawing communities.

## Features
- Layers

- Touch gestures
- Brushes: pen, blend, sketchy, pixel, chemy, smudge, eraser
- Tools: paint bucket, text, shapes, gradient
- WebGL-powered filters: blur, tilt-shift, curves, distort, noise.

# Commands
- initialize via `npm install` (requires node and npm to be installed already)
- `npm run lang:build` - generate language files necessary to run Klecks
- `npm run start` - dev server (to run it locally)
- `npm run build` - build standalone into `/dist/`
- `npm run build:embed` - build of embed into `/dist/`
- `npm run build:help` - build help page (when clicking the questionmark) into `/dist/`

# Embed
Example usage of the embed can be found under: `/examples/embed/`

# Docker
To run Klecks (standalone) within a Docker container, run the following commands in project root:

`docker-compose build`

`docker-compose up -d`

It is then accessible through: http://localhost:5050


# Translations
Are you a native speaker or have advanced skills in a language with no translation yet?
Any contribution by you is highly encouraged and appreciated!

### Where are translation files?
Translations are located in `src/languages` where each translation is its own JSON5 file, e.g. `de.json5` for German.
Within such a file everything except `value` is to be kept in sync with `_base-en.json5`.

### Structure of a translation file
```json5
{
  // key by which this text is referenced in code
  stabilizer: {
    
    // A hint, further explaining the text
    hint: 'Common feature in drawing software to make lines smoother',
    
    // Original text (English)
    original: 'Stabilizer',
    
    // Translated text
    value: 'ÊäñÂä®‰øÆÊ≠£'
  },
  // ...
}
```

### Creating/editing a translation
To **create a new translation** run `npm run lang:add <code>`, which creates `src/languages/<code>.json5`. You find all
(ISO 639-1) language codes in `src/languages/languages.json`. The generated file will already include everything except `value`.
To **edit an existing translation**, simply edit one of the files in `src/languages`. If a language file is out of sync with
`src/languages/_base-en.json5` (English), whatever key is out of sync will be ignored and fall back on English. English is the
source of truth. A translation cannot add new keys without them also being present in `_base-en.json5`.

To **see your changes** in Klecks, run `npm run lang:build`. It needs to be run whenever changes to `src/languages` are
made or it won't be up-to-date. Then build or start Klecks.

A translation should try not to cause additional line-breaks in the UI if possible. Test to make sure translations
fit the context of the application. Note, some texts are only visible in the standalone-version and vice versa with
the embed-version.

### List of commands
- `npm run lang:add <code>` - creates new language file `src/languages/<code>.json5`.
  - See (ISO 639-1) language codes in `src/languages/languages.json`
- `npm run lang:sync <code>` - synchronizes with base file. (TODO)
- `npm run lang:build` - generates JSON & TS files in `src/app/languages`
  - Problems are printed to the command line output
